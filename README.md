# IMDb-Regression

![KDE plot](KDE plot.png)

This project aims to predict the average user rating for movies on [IMDb.com](imdb.com). Feature engineering was done using some domain knowledge of which actors and directors are (in)famously good or bad. An XGBoost model was used with linear regression as a comparison.
